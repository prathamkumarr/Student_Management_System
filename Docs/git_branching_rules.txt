# RULES OF BRANCHING 
--------------------
This document explains how every team member should create, name, and manage branches in our repository.

---
1. Branches
---
Branches let us work on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously without breaking the main (production) code.

Main branch (protected):
- Contains only stable, tested code.
- No direct pushes allowed.
- Everything must go through a Pull Request (PR).

---
2. HOW TO CREATE A NEW BRANCH
---
Before starting any new feature or fix, always:
- Switch to the latest main branch:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

- Create a new branch for your feature/fix:

git checkout -b feat/<branch_name>

Example:
git checkout -b feat/student_dashboard

---
3. WORKFLOW EXAMPLE
---
Example for creating a new student dashboard module:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/student_dashboard

-- make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added base layout for student dashboard"
git push -u origin feat/student_dashboard

- Then create a Pull Request (PR) :- wait for review :- merge to `main`.

---

4. AFTER MERGE
Once your PR is merged into main:
- Delete your feature branch from GitHub (recommended) to avoid overstacking of branches.
- Pull the updated main branch:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

- Don’t reuse old branches. Always make a new one for every feature.
