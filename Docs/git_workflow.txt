GIT WORKFLOW GUIDELINES
-----------------------

PURPOSE:
To maintain a clean, collaborative, and conflict-free Git workflow for the Student Management System team project.


1. REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
-----------------------
Main Branches:
- main : stable production-ready code
- dev  : collective testing branch (before merging into main)

All development must happen on **feature branches** (never directly on main).


2. BRANCH NAMING CONVENTION
---------------------------
Use the format:
feat/<module_name>         : for new features
fix/<module_name>          : for bug fixes
docs/<file_name>           : for documentation updates
refactor/<module_name>     : for code improvement

Examples:
feat/student_module
fix/attendance_api
docs/git_workflow
refactor/database_schema


3. STANDARD WORKFLOW
--------------------
Step-by-Step:

Get latest code before starting any work
    : git pull origin main

Create a new feature branch from main
    : git checkout -b feat/student_dashboard

Do your coding work
    (commit small, logical chunks)

Add and commit changes
    : git add .
    : git commit -m "feat: added student dashboard UI"

Push your branch to GitHub
    : git push -u origin feat/student_dashboard

Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub
    - Target branch: main
    - Title format: feat: short description
    - Add a brief summary of what changed

After PR is approved : merge it into main

Pull the latest main branch again
    : git checkout main
    : git pull origin main


4. COMMIT MESSAGE RULES
-----------------------
Follow the **Conventional Commits** format:
<type>: <short description>

Allowed types:
- feat : new feature
- fix : bug fix
- docs : documentation change
- style : code style (no logic change)
- refactor : code improvement
- test : adding/modifying tests
- chore : maintenance tasks

Examples:
feat: added login validation API
fix: corrected attendance date filter
docs: updated API structure in docs
refactor: improved DB connection handling


5. PULL REQUEST (PR) RULES
--------------------------
- One PR = One logical feature or fix
- PR title should match commit style (feat/fix/docs)
- Always write a short PR description (what + why)
- Don’t merge your own PR (another teammate should review)
- Delete the feature branch after successful merge


6. DAILY TEAM PRACTICES
-----------------------
- Always pull latest main branch before starting new work.
- Never commit directly to main.
- Always commit with meaningful messages.
- Make frequent small commits instead of one large dump.
- Keep your branch short-lived (1 feature = 1 branch).


7. HOW TO HANDLE MERGE CONFLICTS
--------------------------------
If you see a conflict:
1. Run : git pull origin main
2. Git will highlight conflicting files
3. Open files : fix manually
4. Run:
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "fix: resolved merge conflicts"
   - git push


8. HOW TO UPDATE YOUR BRANCH (AFTER MAIN CHANGES)
-------------------------------------------------
If main has been updated and you are still on your branch:
- git checkout main
- git pull origin main
- git checkout feat/your_branch
- git merge main


9. CHECK REMOTE REPO LINK
-------------------------
To confirm repo connection anytime
: git remote -v

Output should show:
origin  https://github.com/prathkumarrr/Student_Management_System.git


10. TEAM MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES
--------------------------------
- Everyone must work on their own branch.
- Each PR must be reviewed by another member.
- Project Lead (Pratham) merges approved PRs to main.
- Code review checklist:
  - Code runs without errors
  - Follows naming conventions
  - Uses proper commit messages
  - Matches API style and folder structure
